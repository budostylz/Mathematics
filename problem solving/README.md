## Two Types of Problems

	To find and prove

##Strategy
	
	1. Hypothesis("the given")
	2. Conclusion("What the Problem is Asking to Find or Prove").

##Pieces of a Solution

	1. Investigation
	2. Argument

##Orientation

	Read Problem Carefully. Pay attenstion to details such as positive vs. negative, finite vs. infinite, etc.

	Begin to classify: is it a "to find" or "to prove" problem? Is the problem similar to others you have seen?

	Carefully identify the hypothesis and the conclusion.

	Try some quick preliminary brainstorming

		Think about convient notation,
		Does a particular method of argument seem plausible?
		Can you guess a possible solution? Trust your intuition.
		Are there key words or concepts that seem important?

	Reread a problem several times.

	Fantasize an answer for a "to find" problem.

	Don't spend too much time on orientation. You are done once you have a clear idea what the problem asks and what the given is.
