##Main Points
	1. Substitution
	2. Elimination
	3. Multivariable
	4. Consistent Independent - One Solution 1 = 1
	5. Consistent Dependent - Many Solutions 0 = 0
	6. Inconsistent - No Solution 9 = 0 -> Contradiction
	7. Free Variable - (variable that can take many values) -> z = a -> Many Solutions
	8. Row Operations
